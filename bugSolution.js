```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $match: {
      "fieldName": { $exists: true, $regex: "someRegex", $options: "i" }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$fieldName",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
];

//This solution will prevent errors by adding the $exists operator to the $match stage. 
//This ensures that only documents that contain the field are matched.
//Alternatively, you could add a $facet stage to separately handle documents with missing field and those with the field.
