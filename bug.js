```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $match: {
      "fieldName": {
        $regex: "someRegex",
        $options: "i"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$fieldName",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
];

// This aggregation pipeline will produce an error if the field 'fieldName' is not present in any documents. 
// In that case, the $group stage will fail because the _id field is empty. 
// MongoDB will throw an error similar to "error processing aggregation pipeline" 
// or "cannot group by null values".
