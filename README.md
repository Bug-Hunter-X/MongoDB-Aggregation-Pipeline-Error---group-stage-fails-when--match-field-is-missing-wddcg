# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Handling Missing Fields in $match

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: failure of the `$group` stage when the field specified in the `$match` stage is missing from all documents.  The issue arises because an empty `_id` field is generated, causing the `$group` operation to fail.

The `bug.js` file contains code illustrating the problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution to avoid the error by either ensuring the field exists or handling the case where the field is missing.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Node.js and MongoDB.
3. Run `bug.js` with a MongoDB collection that lacks the field specified in the `$match` stage.
4. Observe the error message.
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to see how the problem can be solved.
